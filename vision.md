# Reckie - AI-Native Requirements Engineering Platform

## Executive Summary

Reckie is an AI-native requirements engineering platform designed to enable autonomous software development workflows. The platform provides structured, machine-readable requirements that LLM agents can consume to generate code, create tests, manage defects, and maintain GitHub repositories. By establishing a standardized requirements format optimized for AI consumption, Reckie enables fully automated development pipelines from business requirements to production deployment.

## Business Vision

### Core Problem Statement
Current requirements engineering fails to support AI agent development workflows:
- Requirements lack the completeness and unambiguity needed for AI agents to work autonomously
- No structured approach for breaking down development into AI-manageable iterations
- Over-specification of future features creates waste when pivots are needed based on user feedback
- Missing framework for AI agents to review, refine, and iterate on requirements
- Insufficient support for progressive disclosure - detailed specs only when ready to implement

### Solution Vision
Reckie provides an AI-native platform that:
- Captures complete, unambiguous requirements that eliminate guesswork for AI agents
- Supports iterative development cycles where AI agents work on focused, well-defined increments
- Maintains appropriate level of detail - detailed specs for current iteration, high-level vision for future
- Enables AI agents to participate in requirements review and refinement process
- Supports pivot-friendly planning where future features remain flexible until implementation time
