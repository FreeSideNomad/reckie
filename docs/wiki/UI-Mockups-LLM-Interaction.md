## Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile/Tablet Layout Adaptations

```yaml
mobile_layout:
  document_collaboration:
    adaptation: "Stack panels vertically"
    navigation: "Tab-based switching between document and conversation"
    gestures: "Swipe to switch between modes"

  conversation_management:
    adaptation: "Simplified timeline view"
    filtering: "Collapsed filter panel with expand option"
    search: "Prominent search bar at top"

tablet_layout:
  document_collaboration:
    adaptation: "Maintain side-by-side layout with adjusted proportions"
    touch_targets: "Larger buttons and touch areas"
    text_input: "Enhanced on-screen keyboard support"
```

## Accessibility Requirements

```yaml
accessibility:
  keyboard_navigation:
    - "All interactive elements accessible via keyboard"
    - "Clear focus indicators"
    - "Logical tab order"

  screen_readers:

    - "ARIA labels for dynamic content"
    - "Alt text for icons and visual elements"

  conversation_search: "< 500ms for local filtering"

optimization_strategies:
  - "Lazy load conversation history"
  - "Cache document content locally"
  - "Progressive enhancement for AI features"
  - "Efficient state management for real-time updates"
```
