# Essential Use Cases: User-LLM Interaction Framework

## Overview

These essential use cases capture the fundamental user goals and intentions for interacting with LLMs within the Reckie platform, following Alistair Cockburn's Essential Use Cases methodology. The focus is on **what** users want to accomplish and **why**, without prescribing specific UI or technical implementation details.

2. System captures the conversation leading to each decision
3. User can review the reasoning behind any document element
4. System provides traceability from requirements to final content
5. User can revisit and modify decisions with full context

**Extensions**:
- 3a. User needs to explain decisions to others
  - 3a1. User can share relevant conversation excerpts
  - 3a2. System formats decision rationale for stakeholder review

## Supporting Use Cases

### UC-5: Configure AI Assistance Style

**User Goal**: Customize how AI provides assistance based on document type and personal preferences

**Level**: Functional goal

**Primary Actor**: Document Author

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. User specifies document type (vision, requirements, technical spec, etc.)
2. System configures AI with appropriate context and formatting guidelines
3. AI adapts communication style to match document purpose
4. User can fine-tune AI behavior based on preferences
5. System remembers user preferences for future sessions

### UC-6: Handle AI Service Interruptions

**User Goal**: Continue productive work even when AI services are unavailable

**Level**: Functional goal

**Primary Actor**: Any Reckie User

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. User attempts to engage AI assistance
2. System detects AI service unavailability
3. System gracefully informs user of temporary limitation
4. User can continue working in direct editing mode
5. System queues AI requests for when service resumes
6. User receives delayed AI assistance when possible

### UC-7: Review Conversation History

**User Goal**: Understand the evolution of document decisions and AI collaboration

**Level**: Functional goal

**Primary Actor**: Project Stakeholder

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. User wants to understand how a document evolved
2. System provides chronological conversation history
3. User can see relationship between discussions and document changes
4. User identifies patterns in successful AI collaboration
5. User can apply learnings to future document work

## User Intentions and System Responsibilities

### User Intentions
- **Express ideas naturally**: Users want to describe what they need in their own words
- **Maintain control**: Users want final say over all content and decisions
- **Learn and improve**: Users want to get better at collaborative AI work
- **Preserve context**: Users want AI to remember and build on previous work
- **Work efficiently**: Users want AI to accelerate rather than complicate their work

### System Responsibilities
- **Interpret intent**: Understand what users want to accomplish, even when expressed informally
- **Provide relevant context**: Give AI the information needed for helpful suggestions
- **Maintain conversation flow**: Preserve context across interactions and sessions
- **Ensure transparency**: Make AI reasoning visible and understandable
- **Preserve user agency**: Never make changes without explicit user approval
- **Learn from interactions**: Improve AI assistance based on user feedback patterns

## Context Scenarios

### Scenario A: Vision Document Creation
**Context**: Product manager creating initial product vision
**AI Role**: Structure suggestions, stakeholder perspective questions, market context
**Key Interactions**: Goal clarification, audience identification, success metrics definition

### Scenario B: Technical Requirements Refinement
**Context**: Developer refining technical specifications
**AI Role**: Completeness checking, edge case identification, implementation considerations
**Key Interactions**: Requirement validation, technical constraint discussion, acceptance criteria development

### Scenario C: User Story Enhancement
**Context**: Business analyst improving user story quality
**AI Role**: Acceptance criteria suggestions, user journey mapping, scenario validation
**Key Interactions**: User motivation exploration, workflow optimization, stakeholder impact analysis

## Success Patterns

### Effective Collaboration Indicators
- User and AI build on each other's contributions
- Conversations lead to better outcomes than either could achieve alone
- User maintains clear ownership while leveraging AI capabilities
- Document quality improves through iterative refinement
- Context preservation enables efficient work resumption

### Quality Measures
- **Relevance**: AI suggestions align with user goals and document purpose
- **Clarity**: Both user requests and AI responses are understandable
- **Efficiency**: Collaboration accelerates rather than slows document work
- **Control**: User always has clear options to accept, modify, or reject suggestions
- **Learning**: Both user and system improve through interaction patterns

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### User Experience Anti-Patterns
- **Black box suggestions**: AI provides recommendations without explanation
- **Context loss**: System forgets previous conversations or decisions
- **Overwhelming options**: Too many suggestions that paralyze rather than help
- **Forced acceptance**: Difficulty rejecting or modifying AI suggestions
- **Generic responses**: AI ignores document type or project context

### Technical Anti-Patterns
- **Synchronous blocking**: User interface freezes during AI processing
- **Silent failures**: AI errors that leave user confused about system state
- **Data loss**: Conversation or document changes lost due to technical issues
- **Context pollution**: Irrelevant information confusing AI responses
- **Performance degradation**: System becomes slower as conversation history grows
