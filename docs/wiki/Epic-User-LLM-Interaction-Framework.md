12. **As a user**, I want the LLM to ask clarifying questions so that I can provide better requirements

### Priority 5: Collaborative Editing
13. **As a user**, I want the LLM to suggest document changes so that I can improve content quality
14. **As a user**, I want to approve or reject LLM suggestions so that I maintain control over my documents
15. **As a user**, I want to see proposed changes before they're applied so that I can review modifications

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **LLM Service**: OpenAI API integration with error handling and rate limiting
- **Conversation Logger**: Request/response logging with structured storage
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI + Jinja2 templates for user interaction
- **Document Manager**: Markdown file handling with preview/edit modes
- **Context Manager**: Dynamic prompt generation and context retrieval

### Data Flow
1. User submits message through web interface
2. Context Manager enriches prompt with relevant project context
3. LLM Service processes request and logs interaction
4. Response processed for document updates or clarifying questions
5. Web Interface displays results and updates document preview

### Integration Points
- OpenAI API for LLM processing
- File system for document storage
- PostgreSQL for conversation and context storage
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for RAG storage
- GitHub integration (future) for version control
