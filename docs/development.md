# Development Approach and Process Guide

## Overview

This document outlines a domain-first, GitHub-native development approach based on lessons learned from complex software projects. The methodology prioritizes business value, user feedback, and iterative refinement while leveraging AI assistance and maintaining technical excellence.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Domain-First Architecture
**Principle**: Core business domain comes first, supporting domains (auth, user management) come later.
**Implementation**:
- Start with business entity modeling
- Define core use cases before technical infrastructure
- Defer authentication and user management until business logic is validated
- Focus on essential interactions over technical complexity

### 2. GitHub-Native Development
**Principle**: Use GitHub as the single source of truth for all project artifacts.
**Implementation**:
- Vision and context in GitHub Wiki
- Work tracking through GitHub Issues
- Project management via GitHub Projects
- Code in GitHub repositories
- Automation through GitHub Actions

### 3. User-Centric Validation
**Principle**: Validate every significant decision with users before implementation.
**Implementation**:
- Present plans as GitHub Issues for review
- Create UI mocks in structured format (Markdown/YAML) before coding
- Implement feedback loops at every stage
- Prioritize user experience over technical elegance

### 4. Essential Use Cases Methodology
**Principle**: Follow Alistair Cockburn's Essential Use Cases approach.
**Implementation**:
- Start with essential user goals and intentions
- Avoid technical implementation details initially
- Focus on "what" before "how"
- Progressive refinement through structured formats
